# Clipster: Dirs & Files to Clipboard ðŸŽ‰

**Clipster** is a fun and efficient Visual Studio Code extension that helps you copy file and folder structures to your clipboard, complete with emojis for added fun! Whether you're working with files or folders, Clipster is here to streamline your workflow.

## Features

- ðŸ“„ **Copy File Content with Path**: Copies the full path of a file to the clipboard along with its content.
- ðŸ“‚ **Copy Folder Structure**: Copies the structure of the selected folder, including directories and files, while respecting `.gitignore` and a set of default ignored patterns (e.g., `node_modules`, `dist`, etc.).
- ðŸ“‚ðŸ“„ **Copy Folder Structure and Content**: Copies the folder structure and the content of each file within, while ignoring unnecessary files or folders.

## Default Ignored Patterns

By default, Clipster will ignore the following files and folders:

- `node_modules`

This ensures that only relevant files are copied when working with folder structures.
